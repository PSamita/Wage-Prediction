# Wage Prediction

## Project Description
This project aims to predict wages of workers using regression models based on their demographic and employment characteristics. The dataset used is sourced from the March supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey for the year 2012, focusing on single (never married) workers with varying education levels.

## Project Objective
This project aims to leverage data-driven approaches to gain insights into wage determinants and contribute to the understanding of factors influencing income disparities in the workforce.

## Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Building: Linear Regression
* Model Evaluation

## Technologies
* Google Colab

## Results and Interpretations
* Both models highlight the significance of education and experience in determining wages.
* Regional disparities in wages are observed, with individuals in the South and Midwest regions generally receiving lower wages.
